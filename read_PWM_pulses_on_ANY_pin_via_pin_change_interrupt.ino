pulse_reader_w_pin_change_interrupt_singleCh.ino
-read in any pulsing signal on Arduino pin INPUT_PIN (defined below), to get its period (us) & freq (Hz), with a time resolution of 0.5us
--you can read in any pulse, including standard PWM signals, Radio Control (RC) PWM signals, etc. 
-I am using some low-level AVR code, which requires using some built-in Arduino macros to do pin-mapping. 
-this code only reads in a single channel at a time, though it could be expanded to read in signals on every Arduino pin, digital and analog, simultaneously.
--this would be lots of work, so for now I'll leave that up to you.
-this code should be able to read in any pulse between approximately 10~20us and 35.79 minutes; I'll let you experiment
 to find the actual shortest pulse you can measure with it

Circuits:

Option 1) To measure the pulses from an Arduino PWM pin, ex: pin 5 or 9, connect Pin 5 or 9 (a PWM output) to INPUT_PIN (the pulse reader input)
          -see the setup() function for commanding the PWM output to begin, so you can have something to read in

Option 2) To measure an RC PWM servo-type signal coming from an RC Rx:
-Power the Rx by connecting 5V to + on the Rx, and GND to - on the Rx
-Connect the channel signal you want to measure on the Rx to the INPUT_PIN on the Arduino
